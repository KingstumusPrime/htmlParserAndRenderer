# HTML Parser and Renderer

This is a project that I did hoping to learn more about how search engines and browsers work. After learning a bit of browser and search engine theroy I relized it was really an HTML renderer I wanted. After some digging around I found this [guide](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) in rust. Wanting to make sure I actually understood everything I wrote all the code in Python with tkinter.
