# HTML Parser and Renderer

This is a project that I did hoping to learn more about how search engines and browsers work. After learning a bit of browser and search engine theory, I realized it was really an HTML renderer I wanted. After some digging around, I found this [guide](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) in Rust. Wanting to make sure I actually understood everything, I wrote all the code in Python with Tkinter. This guide did not explain how to add text at all. It was this feature that really forced me to learn things like "How does the browser determine font size?" "How exactly does it place things?" etc. In addition, I also expanded the engine to add image support.
